<title>Comedi - Control and Measurement Interface</title>
<body>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The Comedi project develops open-source drivers, tools, and libraries
for data acquisition.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comedi</b> is a collection of drivers for a variety of common
data acquisition plug-in boards.  The drivers are implemented as
a core Linux kernel module providing common functionality and
individual low-level driver modules.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comedilib</b> is a user-space library that provides a
developer-friendly interface to Comedi devices.  Included in the
Comedilib distribution is documentation, configuration and
calibration utilities, and demonstration programs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Kcomedilib</b> is a Linux kernel module (distributed with Comedi)
that provides the same interface as Comedilib in kernel space,
suitable for real-time tasks.  It is effectively a "kernel library"
for using Comedi from real-time tasks.
</p>


<h1>Features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Integrated real-time support for most hardware</li>
<li>High-level library (comedilib)</li>
<li>Application-level device independence</li>
<li>Requires a Linux 2.6 kernel.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Latest version</h1>

<ul>
<li>comedi-0.7.76, released 2008-1-28</li>
<li>comedilib-0.8.1, released 2007-10-28</li>
</ul>

<p>
Comedi and Comedilib are being actively developed, and because of this,
new versions are sometimes buggy.  However, reported bugs are usually
quickly fixed.
