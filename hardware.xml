<title>Hardware Supported by Comedi</title>

<h1>Supported Hardware</h1>

<p>
	There are two main branches (or <i>forks</i>) of the Comedi drivers:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>the original Comedi drivers maintained at comedi.org; and</li>
	<li>the newer Comedi drivers maintained as part of the Linux kernel.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	There are some differences in the supported devices and the names of
	the kernel modules in which they are supported, so they are listed
	below in separate sub-sections for
	<a href="#hw-comedi-org">the original comedi.org drivers</a> and
	<a href="#hw-kernel-org">the newer drivers in the Linux kernel</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="hw-comedi-org">Hardware supported by the comedi.org Comedi drivers</h2>

<p>
	Current as of comedi git 2018-03-14.
</p>

<p>
	N.B. The list is extracted from specially formatted comments in the
	driver sources.  For that reason, some supported devices are unlisted.
	(Notably, all the ADDI-DATA devices are unlisted, but they do not
	follow the usual Comedi driver conventions very well.)

<h2 id="hw-kernel-org">Hardware supported by the Linux kernel Comedi drivers</h2>

<p>
	Current as of Linux kernel 4.15.
</p>

<p>
	N.B. The list is extracted from specially formatted comments in the
	driver sources.  For that reason, some supported devices are unlisted.
	(Notably, several supported ADDI-DATA devices are unlisted.  This will
	be remedied once the specially formatted comments are added to the
	relevant driver sources.)
